Welcome to **[My Coding Journey](https://ljtalks.github.io/my-coding-journey/index.html)
**! This project documents my path as I transition into the world of coding, social media management, content creation, and freelancing.

It's a work in progress, so if sections are not behaving as they should please feel free to [contact me](https://ljtalks.github.io/my-coding-journey/pages/contact.html) to let me know. 

Some of the technologies I plan to use in this project I have not yet covered in my learning. I will continue to document my learning journey as I update the site! 

Thank you for your interest and support.
