            <h2>Why I'm Offering Free Websites...</h2>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Building Skills, Relationships, and Trust</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>Starting a business or launching a new product or service can be both exciting and overwhelming,
                especially when it comes to establishing an online presence.</p>
            <p> For many small business owners and entrepreneurs, creating a website is often the first step in making
                their brand known to the world. But where do you even begin if you're not tech-savvy or on a tight
                budget?</p>
            <h3>That’s where I come in.</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>I’m currently on my own journey to build my skills in web development, and as
                part of
                this, I’m offering free websites to a limited number of small businesses and individuals.</p>
            I want to take a moment to explain why I’m doing this, what I have to offer, and how it could benefit both
            of us.</p>
            <h3>Building Relationships, Not Just Websites.</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p> First and foremost, my goal is to build genuine relationships. I’m not a large company looking to trap
                you with hidden fees or a sales pitch.</p>
            <p> I’m a growing web developer who’s passionate about helping small
                businesses and entrepreneurs succeed.</p>
            <p>By offering free websites, I aim to learn more about your needs
                and challenges while honing my skills.</p>
            <p>This is a collaborative effort where your feedback helps me grow as a developer, and in return, I can
                provide you with a functional, attractive online presence at
                little/no cost.</p>
            <p>I believe that creating websites is <strong>more</strong> than just a technical task; it's about
                understanding a
                business's goals, target audience, and unique value proposition.</p>
            <p>By working closely with you, I hope to create a site that reflects your brand and meets your specific
                needs.</p>
            <p> Whether you're launching your first website or looking to <strong>promote a new product or
                    service</strong>, my aim is to offer something genuinely
                valuable.</p>
            <h3> What I Offer Right Now</h3>
            <p>Currently, I’m offering simple one-page landing sites that are perfect for businesses just starting or
                for promoting a single product or service. These sites are hosted for free, with no hidden costs
                involved. If you want to add a custom domain, I can guide you through that process, and you can purchase
                it through my affiliate links or independently—whatever you prefer. I can also help with things like
                email redirects and setting up on platforms like GitHub Pages or any host of your choice.</p>

            <p> While I recognise my skills are still developing, I’m committed to delivering quality work. I have a
                supportive team of mentors and as I learn and grow, my
                ability to offer more advanced features will expand. I’ll always be transparent about any costs that may
                come with additional services.</p>
            <p> But for now, what I’m offering is a no-strings-attached, simple, and effective solution to help you get
                started online.</p>
            <h3> Why Feedback and Experience Matter to Me</h3>
            <p>One of the main reasons I’m offering these free services is to gain experience and receive honest
                feedback. As a new web developer, every project is a chance to learn and improve. Your insights are
                invaluable in helping me understand what works, what doesn’t, and how I can better serve clients like
                you in the future.</p>
            <p>This experience is not just about building websites; it’s about building trust and demonstrating that
                I’m a reliable and skilled developer who can deliver on promises. By working with real businesses and
                real needs, I’m able to learn much more than I ever could from a textbook or a course. It’s a hands-on,
                practical learning process that benefits both of us.</p>
            <h3> Let’s Build Something Together</h3>
            <p>If you’re feeling lost about how to get your business online or need a simple, no-cost way to promote
                your product or service, I’m here to help. This isn’t just a business transaction; it’s an opportunity
                for both of us to grow and succeed.</p>
            <p>I’m eager to work with people who are as passionate about their ventures. Together, we can create
                something that not only meets your needs but also sets the stage
                for our future success.</p>
