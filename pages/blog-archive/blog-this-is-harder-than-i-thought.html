        <h2>My Rollercoaster Day: Struggles with Blog Design and JavaScript</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h3>This is harder than I thought...</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            Today has been another rollercoaster. I haven't managed to leave the house yet. Again. I woke up at 2am,
            again.
        </p>
        <p>And I broke and fixed and broke and amd broke and fixed my website again, several times.</p>
        <p>It's just gone 12 noon.</p>
        <p>The sun is shining. I was about to head out for a little walk, then something stopped me and here I am again.
        </p>
        <p>I'm trying to get that little picture to sit on the left while the two text elements sit on the right, each
            taking up 50% of the screen width (I'm working on tablet size and above right now, mobile is all good).</p>
        <p>But the blooming thing won't co-operate.</p>
        <p>I've got 3 columns and they're not even in the right order.</p>
        <p>Anyway, that's what's holding me back at the moment. I have so much to write about and tell you all that
            I just want ot get on with it. But until I have my main boilerplate template figured out for the general
            blog styling (and fixed that
            stupid header dropdown menu...)</p>
        <p>I feel like i can't write any posts. </p>
        <p>And then it hit me... like a brick in the face...</p>
        <img src="/pages/blog-archive/blog-images/not-easy.png" alt="This is a bit harder than I thought...">
        </p>
        <p>My simple blog, where I hoped to simply tell my story as I go, is turning into an absolute monster.</p>
        <p>I knew this was coming. I thought I'd hit it this morning "I just don't know how to do this!" I'm suposed to
            be
            working on JavaScript now, first personal project starts at the end of this week (it's Sunday now) and I
            can't
            get the blooming boxes to sit right to make things go where I want them to. </p>
        <p>I was determined not to give up. Having forgotten entirely the process of designing for "mobile first" I've
            happily spent the
            last week working on this site, on my laptop (well my TV actually; can't currently see my 17" laptop screen
            as
            I've <a href="">ruined my eyes</a>) and realised this morning. SO I've reversed engineered it, and mobile is
            looking ok. </p>
        During this process I'm trying very hard to keep my css logical and neat. It's getting very tricky! (You looked,
        didn't you!)</p>
        <p>I was really proud of myself for sticking with it determindely to get the issues corrected so I could go
            and play with JavaScript.</p>
        <p>I solved lots of problems. I hadn't hit the wall after all, then that popped into my
            head.</p>
        <p>I asked chat GPT as there's no-one else here. I know he lies sometimes (he's such a people pleaser) but he's
            got me thinking about things I didn't know existed before so I usually give him a try, cautiously. </p>
        <p>The thing is, I have a sneaky suspicion that this mammoth task might even be easier if I knew some JS...</p>
        <p>Maybe I will go for that walk...</p>
