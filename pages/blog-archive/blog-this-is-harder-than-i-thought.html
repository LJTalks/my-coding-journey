        today has been another rollercoaster. I haven't managed to leave the house yet. Again. I woke up at 2am, again. ANd I broke and fixed and broke and amd broke and fixed my website again, several times. It's just gone 12 noon. The sun us shining. I was about to head out for a little walk, then something stopped me and here I am again. I'm trying to get that little picture to sit on the left while the two text elements sit on the right, each taking up 50% of the screen width (I'm working on tablet size and above right now, mobile is all good). But the blooming thing won't co-operate. I've got 3 columns and they're not even in the right order. ANyway, that's what's olding me back at the moment. I have so much to write about and tell you all that I just want ot  get on with it. But until I have my base plate figured out for the general blog styling (and fixed that stupid header dropdown) 
    </p>
<p>I feel like i can't write any posts. </p>
<p>And then it hit me... like a brick in the face...</p>

<p>My simple blog, where I can tell my story as I go, is turning into an absolute monster.</p>
<p>I knew this was coming. I thought I'd hit it this morning "I just don't know how to do this!" I'm suposed to be working on JavaScript now, first personal project starts at the end of this week (it's Sunday now) and I can't get the blooming boxes to sit right to make things go where I want them to.  </p>
<p>I was determined not to give up. Having forgotten entirely the process of "mobile first" I've happily spent the last week working on this site, on my laptop (well my TV actually; can't currently see my 17" laptop screen as I've ruined my eyes) and realised this morning. SO I've reversed engineered it, and mobile is looking ok.  </p>
During this rocess I'm trying very  hard to keep my css logical and neat. It's getting very tricky! (You looked, didn't you!)</p> 
<p>I was really proud with myself for sticking with it determindely to get the issues corrected so I could go and play with JavaSccript. I solved lots of problems. I hadn't hit the wall after all, then that popped into my head. I asked chat GPT as there's no-one else here. I know he lies but he's got me thinking about things I didn't know existed befre so I usually give him a try cautiously. </p>
<p>the thing is, this mammoth task might even be easier if I knew some JS.</p>
<p>Maybe I will go for that walk...</p>
